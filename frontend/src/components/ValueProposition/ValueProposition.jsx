          <p>
            Over the past 20 years, weâ€™ve developed, tested, patented, and deployed a new technology that relies on oxygen to purify water more completely, faster, and at substantially less expense than any other technology currently available in the market.
          </p>

          <p>
            With small amounts of power, we have found a way to energize oxygen in states beyond ozone, binding to harmful compounds and elements, removing them from water efficiently and at lower cost.
